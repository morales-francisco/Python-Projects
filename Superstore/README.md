# Data Cleaning + EDA - Superstore #


## Introduction ##
Superstore is an american company that sells all kinds of goods.

## Source ##
The data source is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final).

## Objective ##
This project seeks to determine which products, regions, product categories, and customer segments the Superstore should target or avoid.

## Conclusions ##

By examining sales, we may learn about their characteristics, the company's most important products, the categories to which they belong, the regions with the highest sales, etc. This allows us to make some recommendations based on the data:

   - It has already been established that 20% of the products generate 80% of sales, so it makes sense to focus resources there.
   - The 18 products with the highest margin and fastest sales pace are worth paying attention to, in my opinion. To increase the popularity of these products in the central and southern regions of the nation, one suggestion might be to intensify marketing campaigns.
   - Because the products with the highest discount percentage sell the fewest units, the policy could be changed when assigning them to encourage more sales.
   - It has been discovered that 60% of sales are concentrated in the country's eastern and western regions.
   - California and New York account for 35% of total sales. One marketing tactic might be to ramp up promotion efforts in less popular categories. For example, since the Technology category sells the fewest products while producing the highest profits, it would be best to pursue an aggressive sales strategy in this category.
   - The market segment that generates the most revenue, ahead of corporate or home office, is the consumer market. Additionally, the ratio of the various categories remains constant, with the consumer segment consistently ranking first, followed by corporate and home office.
   - The percentage of orders generated by segment has remained constant over time. However, the data only goes up to 2017. Given the pandemic that the world experienced and the rise in remote work by the businesses, it is likely that if the data were to be extended to the present, the proportions between corporate and home offices would be inverted. A wise suggestion would be to focus your efforts on this market segment because this relationship is probably going to last.
